			<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
			</div>
			<p>PDF Reader DocuLuma LLC, with its registered address at 45 Enigma Lane, Land Park, London, UK, EC1A 1BB, Business Registration no. 700468291BC0001 (referred to as "we" or "us"), is committed to ensuring the privacy and protection of the personal data of our users, customers, and suppliers, including prospective individuals (referred to as "you" or "your"). We operate in compliance with Canadian data protection laws (referred to as the "National Law") and the European Regulation no. 679/2016 (referred to as the "GDPR") for individuals in the European Economic Area, collectively known as the "Applicable Law." This Privacy Policy is designed to provide you with information about our practices related to the collection and use of your Personal Data through our website DocuLuma.com (referred to as the "Site") or while providing any of our services (referred to as the "Services"). "Personal Data" refers to information that pertains to an identified or identifiable natural person. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy carefully to gain an understanding of our approach and procedures concerning the processing of your Personal Data.</p><br>

<h2>PERSONAL DATA WE PROCESS:</h2>
<p>When you visit the Site or when we provide you with our Services, we may collect the following Personal Data:</p>
<h3>1.1. Information you give us.</h3>
<p>By using our Site or Services, you may choose to share Personal Data with us voluntarily. This information could include your name, email, address, order details, financial information, and any other data provided during customer support interactions. We handle this data in compliance with Applicable Law, assuming it pertains to you or has been authorized for sharing by relevant third parties. As the data provider, you take on the role of an independent controller, bearing all responsibilities and obligations as required by law. By doing so, you relinquish any rights to disputes, claims, or damages from third parties whose Personal Data is processed through your use of our Site or Services in violation of the law.</p>
<h3>1.2. Browsing data.</h3>
<p>Computer systems and software procedures on the Site collect certain Personal Data as part of internet communication protocols. This information, while not intended for personal identification, may allow identification through processing and association with third-party data. Collected Personal Data includes: (i) IP addresses or domain names of connecting devices; (ii) URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) of requested resources; (iii) request time and method to the server; (iv) file size in the reply; (v) numeric code for server reply status (success, error, etc.); (vi) additional parameters related to your operating system and device environment.</p>
<h3>1.3. Cookies and similar technologies.</h3>
<p>We may collect Personal Data using cookies. You can find further information on the use of cookies and similar technologies here.
WHAT IS DATA RETENTION PERIOD AND WHAT SECURITY MEASURES HAVE BEEN TAKEN FOR YOUR PERSONAL DATA SAFEGUARD</p>
<h3>2.1. Data retention.</h3>
<p>Personal Data collected by us will be processed for the time strictly necessary to achieve the purposes referred to in above. In particular:</p>
<h3>2.1.a.</h3>
<p>Personal Data collected through the provision of Services will be deleted (or anonymized for statistical purposes) after _2_ (_two_) years from the termination of the Services or, if earlier, after your cancellation request;</p>
<h3>2.1.b.</h3>
<p>Personal Data needed for the provision of our newsletter service will be processed until you decide to unsubscribe;</p>
<h3>2.1.c.</h3>
<p>Personal Data whose retention is mandatory under the applicable laws (e.g., tax laws, bookkeeping, etc.) will be retained for a period of time necessary or permitted to comply with such laws.</p>
<h3>2.2. Security measures.</h3>
<p>Security Measures for Personal Data Protection</p>
<p>At DocuLuma LLC, we prioritize the security of your Personal Data. We maintain and continuously update robust technical and organizational security measures to safeguard your information from accidental loss, unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure, especially during data transmission over networks. While we strive to protect your data, it's important to note that no security measures are entirely foolproof. Despite this, we are committed to mitigating risks associated with processing your Personal Data through the following measures:</p>
<h3>2.2.a. Data Minimization.</h3>
<p>We collect, retain, and process only essential Personal Data necessary for our services and legal obligations. Our electronic and physical collections are designed to gather relevant information.</p>
<h3>2.2.b. Pseudonymization.</h3>
<p>Where feasible, we pseudonymize Personal Data to ensure it cannot be linked to a specific individual without additional protected information. We employ encryption and other technical measures to reduce risk and protect data.</p>
<h3>2.2.c. Encryption.</h3>
<p>In addition to pseudonymization, we use encryption as a secondary measure to secure Personal Data during transfer to external parties. This involves utilizing a secret key to render Personal Data indecipherable unless decrypted with the assigned key.</p>
<h3>2.2.d. Access restriction.</h3>
<p>We use company-wide restriction methods for restricting access into the foundation of our processes, systems and structure, in order to ensure that only those with authorization and/or a relevant purpose, have access to Personal Data. Special category data is restricted at all levels and can only be accessed by our authorized personnel.</p>
<h3>2.2.e. No hard copy data.</h3>
<p>We never store any Personal Data in hard copy format.</p>
<p>WHO ARE THE RECIPIENTS OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</p>
<h3>3.1. Third-party service providers or consultants.</h3>
<p>We engage reputable third parties for essential functions such as hosting, maintenance, error monitoring, billing, and more. These providers, including Fastspring (our e-commerce provider), Mailchimp (our mail marketing service provider), Zendesk (our customer support ticketing system provider), and LicenseSpring (our license information service provider), receive your Personal Information solely to facilitate these services. We mandate that these providers uphold strict privacy and security standards when handling your data.</p>
<h3>3.2. Other Third Parties.</h3>
<p>We may share Personal Data with our headquarters, affiliates, and business partners when necessary for the purposes outlined in our Privacy Policy. For instance, our marketing team operates from Canada, customer support office from the Philippines, and financial department from Switzerland.</p>
<h3>3.3. Third parties required by laws or authorities.</h3>
<p>In compliance with legal obligations, we may disclose your data to third parties under specific circumstances, such as to comply with laws, regulations, or governmental requests, to enforce our agreements and policies, or to protect the security of our services and customers. We strive to notify you of any such disclosure requirements unless legally restricted from doing so.</p>
<h3>3.4. Aggregated or de-identified data.</h3>
<p>We also share non-Personal Data (data that is de-identified or aggregated to protect your identity) with third parties for business, marketing, and user behavior analysis purposes. This helps third parties understand our users' interests, habits, and usage patterns related to our programs, content, services, ads, promotions, and features.</p>
<h2>WHERE YOUR PERSONAL DATA MAY BE TRANSFERRED</h2>
<p>While our base is in Canada, we operate as a decentralized business. This means that the Personal Data we collect may be transferred to and stored with our affiliates, partners, or service providers mentioned in Section 4. Such transfers can occur within or outside the European Economic Area. By providing your Personal Data, you consent to these transfers. Please note that your data may be sent to countries with differing data protection laws. Rest assured, we maintain data protection standards outlined in this Privacy Policy when transferring or sharing your information with such countries.</p>
<h2>YOUR RIGHTS</h2>
<h3>4.1. Right of access.</h3>
<p>You have the right to confirm if your Personal Data is being processed. You can access and receive a copy of your Personal Data in an understandable format. Additionally, you can request information about the purposes of processing, categories of Personal Data involved, recipients of the data, storage period, rights to rectify or erase data, and more.</p>
<h3>4.2. Right to withdraw consent.</h3>
<p>You can withdraw your consent to Personal Data processing at any time, including for direct marketing purposes. This action does not affect the legality of processing before the withdrawal.</p>
<h3>4.3. Right to rectification, erasure and restriction.</h3>
<p>You have the right to promptly correct inaccurate or incomplete Personal Data, erase unlawfully processed data, or restrict processing if needed for legal reasons.</p>
<h3>4.4. Right to data portability.</h3>
<p>You have the right to receive your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format. You also have the right to transmit this data to another controller without hindrance from us, where technically feasible.</p>
<h3>4.5. Right to lodge a complaint before an European supervisory authority.</h3>
<p>If you are a European citizen, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the Supervisory Authority located in your place of residence.</p>
<h3>4.6. Contacts.</h3>
<p>To exercise the rights mentioned above, please send your requests to PDF Reader DocuLuma LLC, 45 Enigma Lane, Land Park, London, UK, EC1A 1BB, or via email to contact@doculuma.com. Any access request is typically fulfilled within one month. However, if the retrieval or provision of information is particularly complex or subject to a valid delay, the period may be extended by two further months. In such cases, we will notify the individual within one month and keep them informed of the delay and its reasons.</p>
<h2>AMENDMENTS TO THIS POLICY</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy came into force on the specified date. We reserve the right to amend or update its content, whether in whole or in part, following changes in legal and regulatory obligations regarding data protection. We will inform you of such amendments and updates through their publication on the Site as soon as they are adopted, and they will be binding from the moment of their publication. We encourage you to regularly visit this section of the Site to stay informed about the most recent and updated version of the policy and our processing activities.</p>
